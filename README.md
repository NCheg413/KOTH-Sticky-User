This is an exploit that will attempt to create a backdoor user for a system and work on Linux systems with permissions and internet access by poisoning PAM.

The backdoor makes a user named lacucaracha, the cockroach in Spanish, which can SSH into the system without a valid password.

It will also store the user name and password credentials that other users use to SSH and broadcast it on an HTTP server with this URL: "http://<ipaddr>:49160".

Read the Project Description PDF file for installation instructions and a more in-depth look at how it works. There are some sections in the PDF file  where the user was set to nihargayam. Ignore this and replace all instances of nihargayam with lacucaracha.

Please use this responsibly.
